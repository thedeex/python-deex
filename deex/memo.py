    A memo is encrypted with a shared secret derived from a private key of
    the sender and a public key of the receiver. Due to the underlying
    mathematics, the same shared secret can be derived by the private key
    of the receiver and the public key of the sender. The encrypted message
    is perturbed by a nonce that is part of the transmitted message.
